    <p>Arial was designed in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders to be the exact same width as the font Helvetica, so that a document printed in Arial could be printed without having to pay for a Helvetica license.</p>
    <p>Arial and Helvetica are very simailar but some slight differences in shape.</p>
    <p>Arial is a classic yet contemporary font, designed to almost be bland. It's simplicity and "blandness" make it incredibly versitile, and it has been used in many applications since it's creation. It was one of the 4 original TrueType fonts on Windows 3.1, and has truly thrived as one of the best sans serif fonts today.</p>
